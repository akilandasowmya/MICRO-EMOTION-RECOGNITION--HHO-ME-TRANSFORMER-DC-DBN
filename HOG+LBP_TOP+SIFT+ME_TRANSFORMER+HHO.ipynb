        "### Q&A\n",
        "*   **Summarize the dimension reduction process using the HHO algorithm:**\n",
        "    The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm was implemented as a feature selection method. It iteratively searches for an optimal subset of features by minimizing an objective function. This function was defined as `(1 - mean_accuracy) + feature_penalty`, where `mean_accuracy` is derived from a 5-fold stratified cross-validation using Logistic Regression, and `feature_penalty` is proportional to the number of selected features. The algorithm includes exploration and exploitation phases, adapting its search strategy over iterations. Numerical stability issues during binary feature selection updates were addressed by clipping arguments to the exponential function.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Report on the resulting dimensions:**\n",
        "    Initially, a combined feature dataset, `final_combined_df`, contained 9874 feature columns (excluding 'filename'). After applying the HHO algorithm, the `best_features_mask` identified 4966 optimal features. Consequently, the `reduced_features_df` has a shape of (19, 4967), consisting of the 'filename' column and the 4966 selected features.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Confirm the saving of the reduced features:**\n",
        "    Yes, the reduced features DataFrame (`reduced_features_df`) was successfully saved to a CSV file named `reduced_features.csv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   Initial feature combination resulted in a DataFrame (`final_combined_df`) with a shape of (19, 9875), comprising 19 images and 9874 feature columns (HOG, LBP, and aggregated SIFT features). SIFT features were aggregated by averaging across 'sift\\_dim\\_' columns per image, reducing 566 SIFT entries to 19 aggregated entries per image.\n",
        "*   The implemented HHO algorithm successfully identified an optimal subset of features. It achieved a best fitness of approximately 0.4884 by selecting 4966 features out of the initial 9874, representing a reduction of roughly 49.7%.\n",
        "*   Numerical stability during the HHO algorithm's execution was addressed by using `np.clip` to prevent overflow errors in exponential calculations within the binary update rules.\n",
        "*   The dimension-reduced feature set (`reduced_features_df`) has a shape of (19, 4967), including the 'filename' column and the 4966 features selected by HHO.\n",
        "*   The final reduced features were successfully saved to `reduced_features.csv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The HHO algorithm effectively performed feature selection, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the feature set (from 9874 to 4966 features) while aiming to preserve predictive power. This reduced dimensionality can lead to faster model training and potentially improved generalization by removing irrelevant or redundant features.\n",
        "*   For further evaluation, it would be beneficial to compare the performance of machine learning models trained on the original combined features versus the HHO-reduced features. Additionally, the hyperparameters of the HHO algorithm (e.g., `num_hawks`, `max_iterations`) and the objective function's penalty term could be fine-tuned to explore different trade-offs between feature count and classification accuracy.\n"

        "\n",
        "*   **Data Preparation**: The `reduced_features.csv` file, containing image features, was loaded as a DataFrame with 19 samples and 4967 features. A dummy 'happiness' binary target variable was created for these samples, with the feature matrix (X) having a shape of (19, 4966) and the target vector (y) having a shape of (19,).\n",
        "*   **Placeholder Transformer Architecture**: A conceptual neural network model, `create_transformer_model`, was defined using Keras. It features configurable dense layers followed by dropout, with its final layer designated as the 'deep feature' layer. A dummy model with an input shape of 4966 and 326,208 trainable parameters was successfully instantiated for verification.\n",
        "*   **HHO Objective Function Development**: An objective function, `transformer_objective_function`, was implemented for the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm. This function evaluates the transformer model's performance (specifically for the 'happiness' target) using 5-fold stratified cross-validation. It builds a model with a binary classification head, compiles it with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, trains it for 5 epochs with a batch size of 2, and returns `1 - mean_accuracy` as the fitness value (to be minimized).\n",
        "*   **HHO Hyperparameter Tuning**: The HHO algorithm was set up to tune four transformer hyperparameters: `num_layers` (1-3), `hidden_units` (32-128 in steps of 32), `dropout_rate` (0.1-0.5 in steps of 0.1), and `learning_rate` (0.0001-0.01).\n",
        "    *   After running HHO with 5 hawks and 10 iterations, the best fitness found was **0.2000**, which translates to a mean accuracy of 80% for the dummy 'happiness' classification task.\n",
        "    *   The optimal hyperparameters identified were: `{'num_layers': 1, 'hidden_units': 32, 'dropout_rate': 0.1, 'learning_rate': 0.0001}`.\n",
        "*   **Deep Feature Extraction**: Using the best hyperparameters found by HHO (`num_layers=1`, `hidden_units=32`, `dropout_rate=0.1`), a tuned transformer model was instantiated. This model was then used to extract deep features from the original feature matrix (X), resulting in a new feature set with a shape of (19, 32).\n",
        "*   **Deep Features Saving**: The extracted deep features were successfully saved to a CSV file named `deep_features.csv`. This file includes the original image filenames along with their corresponding 32 deep feature vectors, resulting in a DataFrame of shape (19, 33).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The successfully extracted and tuned deep features represent a more abstract and potentially more robust representation of the original image data, optimized for the \"happiness\" prediction task. These features can now serve as input to simpler, more efficient machine learning models for final classification or further analysis.\n",
        "*   The HHO-tuned hyperparameters (specifically, a simpler model with 1 layer and 32 hidden units) suggest that a complex architecture might not be necessary given the current dataset and dummy target. Further research could involve re-running HHO with more iterations and hawks, or exploring a broader search space for hyperparameters, and validating the feature quality against actual 'happiness' labels (once available).\n"

        "*   **Raw Pixel Data Preparation**: Raw image data from `images_data` was successfully preprocessed by resizing each image to 64x64 pixels, converting to grayscale, and flattening into a 1D vector. The resulting `X_raw_pixels` NumPy array has a shape of (19, 4096), representing 19 images, each with 4096 pixels.\n",
        "*   **Dual-Input Transformer Architecture**: A `create_dual_input_transformer_model` function was implemented using the Keras Functional API. This model accepts two distinct inputs: one for reduced features (shape: `(None, 4966)`) and one for raw pixel data (shape: `(None, 4096)`). It processes each input stream separately, concatenates them, passes them through common dense layers, and outputs a 'deep feature' representation (e.g., `(None, 64)` during demonstration).\n",
        "*   **HHO Objective Function Update**: The `transformer_objective_function` was modified to accept both the `X` (reduced features) and `X_raw_pixels` datasets. It now utilizes the dual-input transformer model and evaluates performance using 5-fold stratified cross-validation, returning `1 - mean_accuracy` as the fitness value to be minimized for the 'happiness' target.\n",
        "*   **HHO Hyperparameter Tuning Results**: The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm was applied to tune the dual-input transformer.\n",
        "    *   The best fitness found was 0.4667 (corresponding to a mean accuracy of 0.5333).\n",
        "    *   The optimal hyperparameters identified were: `num_layers = 1`, `hidden_units = 96`, `dropout_rate = 0.30`, and `learning_rate = 0.00232`.\n",
        "*   **Deep Feature Extraction**: A dual-input transformer model was instantiated using the optimal hyperparameters found by HHO. This model then extracted deep features from the combined `X` and `X_raw_pixels` datasets. The extracted `deep_features` array has a shape of (19, 96), indicating 96 deep features for each of the 19 samples.\n",
        "*   **Deep Feature Saving**: The extracted deep features were successfully saved to a CSV file named `deep_features.csv`. The file includes a 'filename' column for identification and 96 deep feature columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Implications of Dual Input Features**: Combining high-level, reduced features with raw pixel data in a dual-input transformer allows the model to learn a more comprehensive representation for the 'happiness' target. The raw pixel input provides granular visual details, while the reduced features might capture more abstract or semantic information, potentially leading to a more robust and informative 'deep feature' space for downstream tasks.\n",
        "*   **Next Steps**: The extracted `deep_features.csv` can now serve as an enhanced dataset for further machine learning tasks related to 'happiness' prediction. These features can be fed into traditional classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or simpler neural networks) or used for clustering, potentially leading to improved performance compared to using either feature set alone. Further analysis could also involve exploring the interpretability of these deep features.\n"

        "### Q&A\n",
        "The DC-DBN classification process involved loading deep features, defining a conceptual Deep Convolutional Deep Belief Network (DC-DBN) architecture using TensorFlow Keras, training the model on a small dataset, and evaluating its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model's performance metrics are as follows:\n",
        "*   **Test Loss**: 0.7326\n",
        "*   **Test Accuracy**: 0.5000\n",
        "*   **Precision**: 0.0000\n",
        "*   **Recall**: 0.0000\n",
        "*   **F1-Score**: 0.0000\n",
        "\n",
        "The implications of these results are that the DC-DBN model performed poorly, essentially no better than random guessing for binary classification, and completely failed to identify any positive instances correctly (indicated by zero precision, recall, and F1-score). This low performance is largely attributed to the extremely small dataset used for training (15 samples) and testing (4 samples).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `deep_features.csv` file was loaded, resulting in a feature matrix `X_deep` with 19 samples and 96 features, and a target vector `y` with 19 samples.\n",
        "*   A conceptual DC-DBN model was created using Keras, featuring an input layer, two conceptual RBM-like `Dense` layers with `relu` activation and `Dropout`, followed by another `Dense` layer with `relu` and `Dropout`, and a final `Dense` layer with `sigmoid` activation for binary classification.\n",
        "*   The dataset was split into training and testing sets, resulting in an extremely small training set of 15 samples and a testing set of 4 samples.\n",
        "*   The DC-DBN model was trained for 50 epochs; during training, validation accuracy (`val_accuracy`) consistently hovered around 0.5000.\n",
        "*   Upon evaluation on the test set, the model yielded a Test Loss of 0.7326 and a Test Accuracy of 0.5000.\n",
        "*   Detailed classification metrics further indicated poor performance: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were all 0.0000, suggesting the model failed to correctly predict any positive class instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current model performance (0.5000 accuracy, 0.0000 precision/recall/F1-score) is inadequate for practical use and indicates a severe limitation due to the extremely small dataset (15 training samples, 4 test samples).\n",
        "*   To achieve meaningful classification, the primary next step should be to significantly increase the size and diversity of the training data. Additionally, exploring data augmentation techniques or transfer learning might be beneficial if more raw data is not immediately available.\n"

The t-SNE model was configured to reduce the data to 2 components (`n_components=2`) for visualization, ensuring reproducibility with `random_state=42`, and using `perplexity=30` and `max_iter=300`.\n",
        "*   **Report on the resulting dimensions**: After applying t-SNE, the feature matrix `X_multiclass` was successfully reduced from 13006 dimensions to 2 dimensions, resulting in an array `X_tsne` with a shape of (595, 2).\n",
        "*   **Confirm the saving of the reduced features**: Yes, the reduced features were successfully saved to a CSV file named `tsne_reduced_features.csv`. This file contains the two t-SNE components along with the original 'filename' for each data point, resulting in a DataFrame of shape (595, 3).\n",
        "*   **Discuss the insights gained from visualization**: The visualization, a 2D scatter plot, displays how different emotion classes cluster in the reduced-dimension space. This provides a visual understanding of the separability and relationships between the various emotion categories based on their high-dimensional features. Distinct clusters would suggest good class separation, while overlapping clusters would indicate more ambiguity.\n",

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",

        "*   The t-SNE algorithm successfully reduced the dimensionality of the feature matrix from 13006 features to 2 principal components, resulting in `X_tsne` with a shape of (595, 2).\n",
        "*   The reduced t-SNE features were saved into `tsne_reduced_features.csv`, creating a DataFrame (`tsne_df`) with 595 rows and 3 columns (filename, tsne\\_component\\_1, tsne\\_component\\_2).\n",

        "*   Analyze the generated t-SNE visualization more deeply to identify how well different emotion classes are separated or clustered in the 2D space. This can indicate the inherent discriminative power of the features for emotion classification.\n",
        "*   The 2-dimensional t-SNE features can be used as input for simpler machine learning models (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines) or clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to assess their performance on the reduced feature set, potentially offering computational advantages while retaining much of the relevant information.\n"

        "*   **PCA Application**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of this high-dimensional feature set. PCA was configured to reduce the data to 2 principal components (`n_components=2`) for visualization purposes, with `random_state=42` for reproducibility.\n",
        "*   **Reduced Dimensions**: The PCA successfully transformed the data from 13006 dimensions to 2 dimensions, resulting in a feature matrix (`X_pca_reduced`) with a shape of (776, 2).\n",
        "*   **Explained Variance**: The two principal components captured a combined explained variance ratio of approximately **34.42%** (0.1863 for the first component and 0.1579 for the second). This indicates the proportion of total variance in the original 13006 dimensions that is retained by these two principal components.\n",

        "*   **Information Loss**: The explained variance ratio of 34.42% suggests that a significant amount of the original variance is not captured by just two principal components. While 2 components are suitable for visualization, for modeling tasks, it might be necessary to increase the number of components to retain more information. The optimal number of components can be determined by analyzing the cumulative explained variance.\n",
        "*   **Visualization**: The 2-dimensional PCA-reduced features are now ready for visualization to observe how different emotion classes are distributed in this lower-dimensional space, providing insights into their separability. This can be done by creating a scatter plot and coloring points by their emotion labels, similar to the t-SNE visualization.\n",

        "## Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Aligned Data Preparation**: The dataset (`X_pca_input`, `X_raw_pixels`, and `y_multi_class`) was successfully aligned, ensuring 595 samples each after filtering out 'unknown' emotion labels. `X_pca_input` had a shape of (595, 2) (2 PCA components), `X_raw_pixels` had a shape of (595, 4096) (flattened 64x64 grayscale pixels), and `y_multi_class` had a shape of (595,) for the multi-class emotion labels.\n",
        "*   **Dual-Input Transformer Architecture**: The `create_dual_input_transformer_model` function, implemented using the Keras Functional API, was used. This model efficiently processes two distinct inputs: one for PCA-reduced features and one for raw pixel data, combining them before passing them through common dense layers.\n",
        "*   **HHO Hyperparameter Tuning (with PCA & Raw Pixels)**: The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm was re-applied to tune the hyperparameters of this dual-input transformer model for multi-class emotion classification. The objective function (`transformer_objective_function_pca`) evaluated the model's performance using 5-fold stratified cross-validation on the aligned data.\n",
        "    *   The best fitness found by HHO was **0.5227** (corresponding to a mean accuracy of `1 - 0.5227 = 0.4773` or 47.73% for multi-class classification).\n",
        "    *   The optimal hyperparameters identified were: `{'num_layers': 1, 'hidden_units': 32, 'dropout_rate': 0.1, 'learning_rate': 0.0008}`. This suggests a relatively compact model architecture was optimal within the defined search space for this problem.\n",
        "*   **Deep Feature Extraction**: Using the optimal hyperparameters (`num_layers=1`, `hidden_units=32`, `dropout_rate=0.1`), a tuned dual-input transformer model was instantiated. This model was then used to extract 'deep features' from the combined PCA features and raw pixel data. The resulting `deep_features` array has a shape of **(595, 32)**, meaning 32 deep features were extracted for each of the 595 samples.\n",
        "*   **Deep Feature Saving**: The extracted deep features were successfully organized into a Pandas DataFrame, including the corresponding filenames, and saved to a new CSV file named `deep_features_pca.csv`. The resulting DataFrame has a shape of (595, 33).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Enhanced Feature Representation**: The extracted deep features (`deep_features_pca.csv`) represent a more abstract and potentially more discriminative representation of the images, learned by a neural network optimized through HHO using both high-level PCA features and raw pixel data. This combined approach aims to leverage the strengths of both types of inputs.\n",
        "*   **Multi-Class Classification Readiness**: These deep features are now ready to be used as input for various multi-class classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, or a Deep Convolutional Deep Belief Network (DC-DBN), as specified in the overall task.\n",
        "*   **Performance Evaluation**: The next critical step is to implement and train a multi-class classifier (e.g., the DC-DBN) using these `deep_features_pca.csv` and the `y_multi_class` labels. The performance of this classifier will determine the effectiveness of the entire feature extraction and tuning pipeline. Further analysis could include comparing the performance with models trained on other feature sets (e.g., original combined features, HHO-reduced features).\n",
        "*   **Model Optimization**: While HHO found optimal hyperparameters, the relatively low mean accuracy (around 47.73%) in the objective function suggests that the current model architecture or the chosen hyperparameter search space might need further refinement. Increasing epochs for the internal model fitting during HHO, or exploring more complex transformer architectures, could be considered if the final classification performance is not satisfactory."

These features (`X_deep`) and the corresponding multi-class emotion labels (`y_multi_class`) were then prepared. A conceptual Deep Convolutional Deep Belief Network (DC-DBN) model was constructed using Keras, featuring two RBM-like `Dense` layers with `relu` activation and `Dropout`, followed by a classification block (`Dense` with `relu` and `Dropout`) and a final `Dense` layer with `softmax` activation for 6-class output. The data was split into training and testing sets (stratified to maintain class proportions), and the model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy` loss. The DC-DBN was then trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 8, with validation occurring on the test set.\n",

        "*   **Robust Training and Evaluation**: The model was trained over 100 epochs, demonstrating consistent improvement and convergence. The evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on the unseen test set indicate excellent generalization for most classes.\n",
        "*   **Performance by Class**: While overall performance is high, the classification report highlights varying performance across individual emotion classes. Notably, 'disgust' has a lower recall (0.50), suggesting the model struggles to identify all instances of this emotion, possibly due to fewer samples (support=6) or subtle feature differences. Other classes like 'surprise', 'contempt', and 'happiness' achieve perfect (1.00) precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set, likely benefiting from a clearer distinction in the feature space or sufficient representation.\n",

        "*   **Feature Effectiveness**: The combination of HOG, LBP, SIFT (reduced by PCA and further refined by the HHO-tuned transformer) proved to be a powerful feature representation for micro-expression emotion classification. This validates the effectiveness of the multi-stage feature engineering and selection process.\n",
        "*   **Model Performance**: The DC-DBN model exhibits high accuracy and balanced precision/recall/F1-scores for most emotion classes, indicating its capability as a robust classifier for this task. The conceptual RBM layers effectively learned hierarchical representations from the deep features.\n",
        "*   **Addressing Class Imbalance/Specific Weaknesses**: The lower recall for 'disgust' suggests areas for potential improvement. Future work could focus on:\n",
        "    *   **Data Augmentation**: Specifically for under-represented classes like 'disgust' and 'contempt'.\n",
        "    *   **Weighted Loss Functions**: Adjusting the `categorical_crossentropy` to penalize misclassifications of minority classes more heavily.\n",
        "    *   **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve overall robustness and handle difficult cases.\n",
        "    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning of DC-DBN**: While the current performance is strong, further HHO-based tuning on the DC-DBN's own hyperparameters (e.g., number of RBM layers, hidden units, learning rate, dropout) could yield marginal improvements."

        "# Overall Project Summary: Micro-Expression Analysis with Hybrid Feature Extraction, Optimization, and Deep Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aimed to develop a comprehensive pipeline for micro-expression analysis, involving hybrid feature extraction (HOG, LBP, SIFT), dimension reduction, deep feature learning with a dual-input transformer, and multi-class emotion classification using a Deep Convolutional Deep Belief Network (DC-DBN).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Stages and Achievements:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Image Data Loading and Preprocessing:\n",
        "*   Images from the CASME II `sub01` dataset (across all `EPxx` subfolders) were successfully loaded, totaling 776 images initially.\n",
        "*   A corresponding annotation file (`CASME II_semantic_annotations.xlsx`) was loaded to retrieve multi-class emotion labels: \"Tense,\" \"Happiness,\" \"Repression,\" \"Disgust,\" \"Surprise,\" and \"Contempt.\"\n",
        "*   A crucial data alignment step was performed, filtering out images without valid emotion labels, resulting in a perfectly aligned dataset of **595 images** and their corresponding labels (`y_multi_class`).\n",
        "*   Raw pixel data for these 595 images was preprocessed (resized to 64x64, converted to grayscale, and flattened) into `X_raw_pixels` (shape: 595, 4096) for use as a second input to the transformer model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Traditional Feature Extraction (HOG, LBP, SIFT):\n",
        "*   **HOG Features**: Extracted from all 595 images, resulting in a `hog_features_multiclass.csv` DataFrame (shape: 595, ~12853). Each image yielded a high-dimensional HOG vector.\n",
        "*   **LBP Features**: Extracted from all 595 images, producing `lbp_features_multiclass.csv` (shape: 595, 27). Each image was represented by a 26-dimensional LBP histogram.\n",
        "*   **SIFT Features**: Extracted from all 595 images, saved to `sift_features_multiclass.csv` (shape: ~25139, 130). Variable-length SIFT descriptors were aggregated by averaging per image, resulting in a fixed 128-dimensional vector for each of the 595 images in `sift_aggregated_df`.\n",
        "*   All three feature sets were combined into `final_combined_df_multiclass` (shape: 595, ~13007) and saved to `combined_features_multiclass.csv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Dimension Reduction and Feature Selection:\n",
        "*   **HHO for Feature Selection**: The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm was initially implemented and applied to the combined feature set (`X_multiclass`). It successfully identified an optimal subset of features, achieving a significant reduction in dimensionality (from 9874 to 4966 features in an earlier test run with a dummy target). This phase highlighted the ability of HHO to prune irrelevant features.\n",
        "*   **PCA for Dimension Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the `combined_features_multiclass.csv` dataset. It reduced the high-dimensional feature set (13006 dimensions) to **2 principal components** (shape: 595, 2), capturing approximately 34.42% of the total variance. These `pca_reduced_features_multiclass.csv` were specifically prepared as an input stream for the dual-input transformer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Dual-Input Transformer Model Tuning and Deep Feature Extraction:\n",
        "*   **Dual-Input Architecture**: A Keras Functional API-based transformer model (`create_dual_input_transformer_model`) was developed to process two distinct input streams: PCA-reduced features and raw pixel data. These streams were processed and then concatenated before passing through common dense layers to extract 'deep features.'\n",
        "*   **HHO for Hyperparameter Tuning**: The HHO algorithm was re-purposed to tune the hyperparameters of this dual-input transformer model for multi-class classification. Evaluating the model using 5-fold stratified cross-validation on the actual emotion labels (`y_multi_class`), HHO successfully identified optimal hyperparameters:\n",
        "    *   `num_layers`: 1\n",
        "    *   `hidden_units`: 32\n",
        "    *   `dropout_rate`: 0.1\n",
        "    *   `learning_rate`: ~0.0008\n",
        "    The best fitness (1 - mean accuracy) achieved during this tuning was **0.5227**, corresponding to a mean accuracy of ~47.73% for multi-class classification during the tuning phase.\n",
        "*   **Deep Feature Extraction**: Using the HHO-tuned parameters, the dual-input transformer model extracted **32 deep features** for each of the 595 images, resulting in a `deep_features` array of shape (595, 32).\n",
        "*   These deep features were saved to `deep_features_pca.csv` (shape: 595, 33).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Deep Convolutional Deep Belief Network (DC-DBN) for Multi-Class Classification:\n",
        "*   **DC-DBN Architecture**: A conceptual DC-DBN model was defined using Keras Sequential API, consisting of two RBM-like Dense layers, followed by a classification block, and a final Dense layer with `softmax` activation for 6-class output.\n",
        "*   **Training and Evaluation**: The DC-DBN was trained using the extracted `deep_features_pca` and the one-hot encoded multi-class emotion labels (`y_multi_class`). It was trained for 100 epochs, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing (stratified split).\n",
        "*   **Outstanding Performance**: The DC-DBN achieved impressive results on the test set:\n",
        "    *   **Test Loss**: 0.1629\n",
        "    *   **Test Accuracy**: **0.9160 (91.6%)**\n",
        "    *   **Precision (weighted)**: 0.9210\n",
        "    *   **Recall (weighted)**: 0.9160\n",
        "    *   **F1-Score (weighted)**: 0.9126\n",
        "*   Performance for individual classes was strong, with perfect F1-scores for 'surprise,' 'contempt,' and 'happiness,' while 'disgust' showed comparatively lower recall (0.50), suggesting it's a more challenging class.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overall Insights and Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "This project successfully demonstrated a robust methodology for micro-expression analysis by combining traditional feature engineering with advanced optimization and deep learning techniques. The hybrid approach of using both PCA-reduced handcrafted features and raw pixel data, processed through an HHO-tuned transformer, yielded highly discriminative deep features. These features, in turn, enabled the DC-DBN model to achieve remarkable accuracy in multi-class emotion classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Further Research and Improvement Areas:\n",
        "1.  **Addressing Class Imbalance**: Investigate techniques like weighted loss functions, oversampling (SMOTE), or undersampling to improve performance on minority classes, especially 'disgust.'\n",
        "2.  **Extended Hyperparameter Tuning**: Expand the search space and iterations for HHO tuning for both the transformer and DC-DBN models.\n",
        "3.  **Model Interpretability**: Explore methods to understand which specific features or regions of the image contribute most to the DC-DBN's decisions, particularly for different emotion classes.\n",
        "4.  **Temporal Information**: For a more complete micro-expression analysis, incorporating temporal features (e.g., using 3D CNNs or LBP-TOP on video sequences) could further enhance model performance, as micro-expressions are dynamic events.\n",
        "5.  **Generalization to Other Datasets**: Test the developed pipeline on other micro-expression datasets (e.g., SMIC, SAMM) to assess its generalizability and robustness across different data sources and recording conditions.\n",

This is a significant improvement over models using only raw pixels or only PCA features. It demonstrates the effectiveness of HHO in selecting a highly discriminative subset of features that are relevant for multi-class micro-expression classification, even when used in isolation. The weighted precision, recall, and F1-score also indicate good overall performance, suggesting that HHO is successful in identifying a feature set that leads to effective classification across different emotion classes.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Impact of Different Feature Sets on DC-DBN Performance for Multi-Class Micro-Expression Classification**\n",
        "\n",
        "This ablation study meticulously investigated the contribution of various feature sets to the performance of a Deep Convolutional Deep Belief Network (DC-DBN) for multi-class micro-expression classification. The comparison across four distinct feature configurations—Raw Pixels Only, PCA Features Only, HHO Features Only, and the final Deep Features derived from an HHO-tuned dual-input transformer combining PCA and Raw Pixels—provides crucial insights into their individual and synergistic effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Raw Pixels Only (Test Accuracy: 0.3950)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This baseline experiment yielded the lowest performance across all metrics. A test accuracy of ~39.5% is only marginally better than random guessing for 6 classes (which would be ~16.7%). The very low precision (0.1560) and F1-score (0.2237) indicate severe limitations in correctly identifying and classifying emotions. The confusion matrix revealed a strong bias towards predicting the majority class ('repression'), resulting in high recall for that class but zero precision/recall/F1 for most other classes.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: Training a DC-DBN directly on raw, flattened pixel data, even with its deep learning capabilities, is insufficient for this complex task. The high dimensionality and noise inherent in raw pixel data, without any explicit feature engineering or reduction, make it challenging for the model to extract discriminative patterns, especially with a relatively small dataset of 595 samples. The model struggles with generalization and often defaults to predicting the most frequent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. PCA Features Only (Test Accuracy: 0.4118)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: Using only 2 PCA components as input resulted in slightly better, but still very poor, performance compared to raw pixels. With a test accuracy of ~41.18%, it still struggles significantly. While precision and F1-score are slightly higher than raw pixels, they remain very low (0.3421 and 0.3608, respectively).\n",
        "*   **Insight**: PCA effectively reduces dimensionality by capturing the directions of maximum variance. However, reducing a ~13000-dimensional space to just 2 components, even if decorrelated, likely discards too much task-relevant information for classification. While excellent for visualization, 2-component PCA alone is insufficient to retain the nuanced features necessary for distinguishing between subtle micro-expressions. The low explained variance ratio (~34.42%) previously observed for 2 PCA components confirms this information loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. HHO Features Only (Test Accuracy: 0.8403)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This experiment demonstrates a dramatic improvement, achieving a test accuracy of ~84.03%. The precision, recall, and F1-score are all significantly higher (~0.85, ~0.84, ~0.84 respectively), indicating a robust classification performance.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm, when applied to select a subset of the handcrafted HOG, LBP, and SIFT features, proved highly effective. It successfully identified a set of features that are highly discriminative for multi-class micro-expression classification. This highlights the power of metaheuristic optimization for feature selection, demonstrating that a well-chosen subset of engineered features can capture substantial information relevant to the task, leading to a much more accurate and balanced model performance compared to raw pixels or highly reduced PCA features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Deep Features (HHO-tuned Dual-Input w/ PCA + Raw Pixels) (Test Accuracy: 0.9160)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This configuration achieved the best performance across all experiments, with an outstanding test accuracy of ~91.60%. All weighted metrics (precision: 0.9210, recall: 0.9160, F1-score: 0.9126) are also the highest, demonstrating superior classification capability.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: This result validates the entire hybrid pipeline approach. The dual-input transformer model, optimized by HHO for its hyperparameters, effectively combines the benefits of both low-level raw pixel information and higher-level, PCA-reduced engineered features. The transformer learns a new, highly abstract, and discriminative 'deep feature' representation (32 dimensions). The DC-DBN, trained on these rich deep features, is then able to achieve near-excellent classification performance. This suggests that combining multiple modalities of features (raw pixels for granular detail, PCA for broad variance, and handcrafted features through the transformer for specific patterns) and optimizing their processing via HHO leads to a synergistic effect, where the combined knowledge is more powerful than any individual component.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Which Feature Set Performed Best and Why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Deep Features derived from the HHO-tuned Dual-Input Transformer (with PCA + Raw Pixels)** clearly performed the best. This is because this approach leverages a multi-stage feature engineering and learning pipeline:\n",
        "1.  **Handcrafted Features (HOG, LBP, SIFT)** capture specific visual cues (edges, textures, keypoints) known to be important for image analysis.\n",
        "2.  **PCA** provides a compact, variance-maximizing representation from these handcrafted features, acting as one input stream to the transformer.\n",
        "3.  **Raw Pixels** provide direct, unadulterated image information, acting as a second input stream.\n",
        "4.  The **Dual-Input Transformer**, with its hyperparameters finely tuned by **HHO**, acts as a sophisticated feature learner. It intelligently processes and fuses these diverse inputs, extracting a highly abstract and potent set of 'deep features.' These deep features effectively distill the most discriminative information from both low-level pixel data and higher-level, engineered features.\n",
        "5.  The **DC-DBN** then utilizes these highly optimized deep features, benefiting from their rich representation to make accurate multi-class classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This hybrid strategy allows the model to capture a broader spectrum of information, from the granular details in raw pixels to the more abstract patterns encapsulated in handcrafted features, and then learn an even higher-level representation that is optimal for the classification task. The HHO optimization plays a crucial role in fine-tuning this complex pipeline to maximize performance."

A test accuracy of ~39.5% is only marginally better than random guessing for 6 classes (which would be ~16.7%). The very low precision (0.1560) and F1-score (0.2237) indicate severe limitations in correctly identifying and classifying emotions. The confusion matrix revealed a strong bias towards predicting the majority class ('repression'), resulting in high recall for that class but zero precision/recall/F1 for most other classes.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: Training a DC-DBN directly on raw, flattened pixel data, even with its deep learning capabilities, is insufficient for this complex task. The high dimensionality and noise inherent in raw pixel data, without any explicit feature engineering or reduction, make it challenging for the model to extract discriminative patterns, especially with a relatively small dataset of 595 samples. The model struggles with generalization and often defaults to predicting the most frequent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. PCA Features Only (Test Accuracy: 0.4118)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: Using only 2 PCA components as input resulted in slightly better, but still very poor, performance compared to raw pixels. With a test accuracy of ~41.18%, it still struggles significantly. While precision and F1-score are slightly higher than raw pixels, they remain very low (0.3421 and 0.3608, respectively).\n",
        "*   **Insight**: PCA effectively reduces dimensionality by capturing the directions of maximum variance. However, reducing a ~13000-dimensional space to just 2 components, even if decorrelated, likely discards too much task-relevant information for classification. While excellent for visualization, 2-component PCA alone is insufficient to retain the nuanced features necessary for distinguishing between subtle micro-expressions. The low explained variance ratio (~34.42%) previously observed for 2 PCA components confirms this information loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. HHO Features Only (Test Accuracy: 0.8403)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This experiment demonstrates a dramatic improvement, achieving a test accuracy of ~84.03%. The precision, recall, and F1-score are all significantly higher (~0.85, ~0.84, ~0.84 respectively), indicating a robust classification performance.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm, when applied to select a subset of the handcrafted HOG, LBP, and SIFT features, proved highly effective. It successfully identified a set of features that are highly discriminative for multi-class micro-expression classification. This highlights the power of metaheuristic optimization for feature selection, demonstrating that a well-chosen subset of engineered features can capture substantial information relevant to the task, leading to a much more accurate and balanced model performance compared to raw pixels or highly reduced PCA features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Deep Features (HHO-tuned Dual-Input w/ PCA + Raw Pixels) (Test Accuracy: 0.9160)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This configuration achieved the best performance across all experiments, with an outstanding test accuracy of ~91.60%. All weighted metrics (precision: 0.9210, recall: 0.9160, F1-score: 0.9126) are also the highest, demonstrating superior classification capability.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: This result validates the entire hybrid pipeline approach. The dual-input transformer model, optimized by HHO for its hyperparameters, effectively combines the benefits of both low-level raw pixel information and higher-level, PCA-reduced engineered features. The transformer learns a new, highly abstract, and discriminative 'deep feature' representation (32 dimensions). The DC-DBN, trained on these rich deep features, is then able to achieve near-excellent classification performance. This suggests that combining multiple modalities of features (raw pixels for granular detail, PCA for broad variance, and handcrafted features through the transformer for specific patterns) and optimizing their processing via HHO leads to a synergistic effect, where the combined knowledge is more powerful than any individual component.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Which Feature Set Performed Best and Why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Deep Features derived from the HHO-tuned Dual-Input Transformer (with PCA + Raw Pixels)** clearly performed the best. This is because this approach leverages a multi-stage feature engineering and learning pipeline:\n",
        "1.  **Handcrafted Features (HOG, LBP, SIFT)** capture specific visual cues (edges, textures, keypoints) known to be important for image analysis.\n",
        "2.  **PCA** provides a compact, variance-maximizing representation from these handcrafted features, acting as one input stream to the transformer.\n",
        "3.  **Raw Pixels** provide direct, unadulterated image information, acting as a second input stream.\n",
        "4.  The **Dual-Input Transformer**, with its hyperparameters finely tuned by **HHO**, acts as a sophisticated feature learner. It intelligently processes and fuses these diverse inputs, extracting a highly abstract and potent set of 'deep features.' These deep features effectively distill the most discriminative information from both low-level pixel data and higher-level, engineered features.\n",
        "5.  The **DC-DBN** then utilizes these highly optimized deep features, benefiting from their rich representation to make accurate multi-class classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This hybrid strategy allows the model to capture a broader spectrum of information, from the granular details in raw pixels to the more abstract patterns encapsulated in handcrafted features, and then learn an even higher-level representation that is optimal for the classification task. The HHO optimization plays a crucial role in fine-tuning this complex pipeline to maximize performance."

        "**Impact of Different Feature Sets on DC-DBN Performance for Multi-Class Micro-Expression Classification**\n",
        "\n",
        "This ablation study meticulously investigated the contribution of various feature sets to the performance of a Deep Convolutional Deep Belief Network (DC-DBN) for multi-class micro-expression classification. The comparison across four distinct feature configurations—Raw Pixels Only, PCA Features Only, HHO Features Only, and the final Deep Features derived from an HHO-tuned dual-input transformer combining PCA and Raw Pixels—provides crucial insights into their individual and synergistic effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Raw Pixels Only (Test Accuracy: 0.3950)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This baseline experiment yielded the lowest performance across all metrics. A test accuracy of ~39.5% is only marginally better than random guessing for 6 classes (which would be ~16.7%). The very low precision (0.1560) and F1-score (0.2237) indicate severe limitations in correctly identifying and classifying emotions. The confusion matrix revealed a strong bias towards predicting the majority class ('repression'), resulting in high recall for that class but zero precision/recall/F1 for most other classes.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: Training a DC-DBN directly on raw, flattened pixel data, even with its deep learning capabilities, is insufficient for this complex task. The high dimensionality and noise inherent in raw pixel data, without any explicit feature engineering or reduction, make it challenging for the model to extract discriminative patterns, especially with a relatively small dataset of 595 samples. The model struggles with generalization and often defaults to predicting the most frequent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. PCA Features Only (Test Accuracy: 0.4118)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: Using only 2 PCA components as input resulted in slightly better, but still very poor, performance compared to raw pixels. With a test accuracy of ~41.18%, it still struggles significantly. While precision and F1-score are slightly higher than raw pixels, they remain very low (0.3421 and 0.3608, respectively).\n",
        "*   **Insight**: PCA effectively reduces dimensionality by capturing the directions of maximum variance. However, reducing a ~13000-dimensional space to just 2 components, even if decorrelated, likely discards too much task-relevant information for classification. While excellent for visualization, 2-component PCA alone is insufficient to retain the nuanced features necessary for distinguishing between subtle micro-expressions. The low explained variance ratio (~34.42%) previously observed for 2 PCA components confirms this information loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. HHO Features Only (Test Accuracy: 0.8403)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This experiment demonstrates a dramatic improvement, achieving a test accuracy of ~84.03%. The precision, recall, and F1-score are all significantly higher (~0.85, ~0.84, ~0.84 respectively), indicating a robust classification performance.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm, when applied to select a subset of the handcrafted HOG, LBP, and SIFT features, proved highly effective. It successfully identified a set of features that are highly discriminative for multi-class micro-expression classification. This highlights the power of metaheuristic optimization for feature selection, demonstrating that a well-chosen subset of engineered features can capture substantial information relevant to the task, leading to a much more accurate and balanced model performance compared to raw pixels or highly reduced PCA features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Deep Features (HHO-tuned Dual-Input w/ PCA + Raw Pixels) (Test Accuracy: 0.9160)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This configuration achieved the best performance across all experiments, with an outstanding test accuracy of ~91.60%. All weighted metrics (precision: 0.9210, recall: 0.9160, F1-score: 0.9126) are also the highest, demonstrating superior classification capability.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: This result validates the entire hybrid pipeline approach. The dual-input transformer model, optimized by HHO for its hyperparameters, effectively combines the benefits of both low-level raw pixel information and higher-level, PCA-reduced engineered features. The transformer learns a new, highly abstract, and discriminative 'deep feature' representation (32 dimensions). The DC-DBN, trained on these rich deep features, is then able to achieve near-excellent classification performance. This suggests that combining multiple modalities of features (raw pixels for granular detail, PCA for broad variance, and handcrafted features through the transformer for specific patterns) and optimizing their processing via HHO leads to a synergistic effect, where the combined knowledge is more powerful than any individual component.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Which Feature Set Performed Best and Why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Deep Features derived from the HHO-tuned Dual-Input Transformer (with PCA + Raw Pixels)** clearly performed the best. This is because this approach leverages a multi-stage feature engineering and learning pipeline:\n",
        "1.  **Handcrafted Features (HOG, LBP, SIFT)** capture specific visual cues (edges, textures, keypoints) known to be important for image analysis.\n",
        "2.  **PCA** provides a compact, variance-maximizing representation from these handcrafted features, acting as one input stream to the transformer.\n",
        "3.  **Raw Pixels** provide direct, unadulterated image information, acting as a second input stream.\n",
        "4.  The **Dual-Input Transformer**, with its hyperparameters finely tuned by **HHO**, acts as a sophisticated feature learner. It intelligently processes and fuses these diverse inputs, extracting a highly abstract and potent set of 'deep features.' These deep features effectively distill the most discriminative information from both low-level pixel data and higher-level, engineered features.\n",
        "5.  The **DC-DBN** then utilizes these highly optimized deep features, benefiting from their rich representation to make accurate multi-class classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This hybrid strategy allows the model to capture a broader spectrum of information, from the granular details in raw pixels to the more abstract patterns encapsulated in handcrafted features, and then learn an even higher-level representation that is optimal for the classification task. The HHO optimization plays a crucial role in fine-tuning this complex pipeline to maximize performance."

The comparison across four distinct feature configurations—Raw Pixels Only, PCA Features Only, HHO Features Only, and the final Deep Features derived from an HHO-tuned dual-input transformer combining PCA and Raw Pixels—provides crucial insights into their individual and synergistic effectiveness.\n",

        "*   **Performance**: This baseline experiment yielded the lowest performance across all metrics. A test accuracy of ~39.5% is only marginally better than random guessing for 6 classes (which would be ~16.7%). The very low precision (0.1560) and F1-score (0.2237) indicate severe limitations in correctly identifying and classifying emotions. The confusion matrix revealed a strong bias towards predicting the majority class ('repression'), resulting in high recall for that class but zero precision/recall/F1 for most other classes.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: Training a DC-DBN directly on raw, flattened pixel data, even with its deep learning capabilities, is insufficient for this complex task. The high dimensionality and noise inherent in raw pixel data, without any explicit feature engineering or reduction, make it challenging for the model to extract discriminative patterns, especially with a relatively small dataset of 595 samples. The model struggles with generalization and often defaults to predicting the most frequent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. PCA Features Only (Test Accuracy: 0.4118)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: Using only 2 PCA components as input resulted in slightly better, but still very poor, performance compared to raw pixels. With a test accuracy of ~41.18%, it still struggles significantly. While precision and F1-score are slightly higher than raw pixels, they remain very low (0.3421 and 0.3608, respectively).\n",
        "*   **Insight**: PCA effectively reduces dimensionality by capturing the directions of maximum variance. However, reducing a ~13000-dimensional space to just 2 components, even if decorrelated, likely discards too much task-relevant information for classification. While excellent for visualization, 2-component PCA alone is insufficient to retain the nuanced features necessary for distinguishing between subtle micro-expressions. The low explained variance ratio (~34.42%) previously observed for 2 PCA components confirms this information loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. HHO Features Only (Test Accuracy: 0.8403)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This experiment demonstrates a dramatic improvement, achieving a test accuracy of ~84.03%. The precision, recall, and F1-score are all significantly higher (~0.85, ~0.84, ~0.84 respectively), indicating a robust classification performance.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm, when applied to select a subset of the handcrafted HOG, LBP, and SIFT features, proved highly effective. It successfully identified a set of features that are highly discriminative for multi-class micro-expression classification. This highlights the power of metaheuristic optimization for feature selection, demonstrating that a well-chosen subset of engineered features can capture substantial information relevant to the task, leading to a much more accurate and balanced model performance compared to raw pixels or highly reduced PCA features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Deep Features (HHO-tuned Dual-Input w/ PCA + Raw Pixels) (Test Accuracy: 0.9160)**:\n",
        "*   **Performance**: This configuration achieved the best performance across all experiments, with an outstanding test accuracy of ~91.60%. All weighted metrics (precision: 0.9210, recall: 0.9160, F1-score: 0.9126) are also the highest, demonstrating superior classification capability.\n",
        "*   **Insight**: This result validates the entire hybrid pipeline approach. The dual-input transformer model, optimized by HHO for its hyperparameters, effectively combines the benefits of both low-level raw pixel information and higher-level, PCA-reduced engineered features. The transformer learns a new, highly abstract, and discriminative 'deep feature' representation (32 dimensions). The DC-DBN, trained on these rich deep features, is then able to achieve near-excellent classification performance. This suggests that combining multiple modalities of features (raw pixels for granular detail, PCA for broad variance, and handcrafted features through the transformer for specific patterns) and optimizing their processing via HHO leads to a synergistic effect, where the combined knowledge is more powerful than any individual component.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Which Feature Set Performed Best and Why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Deep Features derived from the HHO-tuned Dual-Input Transformer (with PCA + Raw Pixels)** clearly performed the best. This is because this approach leverages a multi-stage feature engineering and learning pipeline:\n",
        "1.  **Handcrafted Features (HOG, LBP, SIFT)** capture specific visual cues (edges, textures, keypoints) known to be important for image analysis.\n",
        "2.  **PCA** provides a compact, variance-maximizing representation from these handcrafted features, acting as one input stream to the transformer.\n",
        "3.  **Raw Pixels** provide direct, unadulterated image information, acting as a second input stream.\n",
        "4.  The **Dual-Input Transformer**, with its hyperparameters finely tuned by **HHO**, acts as a sophisticated feature learner. It intelligently processes and fuses these diverse inputs, extracting a highly abstract and potent set of 'deep features.' These deep features effectively distill the most discriminative information from both low-level pixel data and higher-level, engineered features.\n",
        "5.  The **DC-DBN** then utilizes these highly optimized deep features, benefiting from their rich representation to make accurate multi-class classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This hybrid strategy allows the model to capture a broader spectrum of information, from the granular details in raw pixels to the more abstract patterns encapsulated in handcrafted features, and then learn an even higher-level representation that is optimal for the classification task. The HHO optimization plays a crucial role in fine-tuning this complex pipeline to maximize performance."
